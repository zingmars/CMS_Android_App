# Dankpress app

Android client for a CMS I wrote in CakePHP. You could say this is my "Hello World" app for Android. It's quite unfinished (and I don't intend to ever finish it since it was a homework assignment), and only has basic functionality -

* Get post feed
* Log in/out
* View/Add/Edit/Delete comments

Be warned - The source code's a bit chaotic and needs some major refactoring, since I literally had no idea what I'm getting into and at some point it became more about finishing the app than making it good.
